<h1 align="center">Testing of an Intelligent Programming Interface</h1>

<p>
    This job is part of a research study being conducted by Graham Neubig at
    Carnegie Mellon University. This job involves testing out an intelligent
    programming interface that allows you to command your computer in English
    and generate code corresponding to what you want the computer to do. For
    example, you would enter the command:
</p>
<p>
    * <strong>Command:</strong> Sort list my_list in reverse alphabetical order
</p>
<p>
    and the computer would generate the below snippet:
</p>
<p>
    * <strong>Snippet: </strong>my_list.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x:
    str(x))
</p>
<p>
    Our hope is that this interface will eventually be useful to programmers,
    and your feedback on our early prototype will be invaluable in assessing
    its usefulness.
</p>
<p>
    If you participate in the study, you will be asked to solve several simple
    programming tasks with and without the interface. We will measure the time
    required to perform the task, and assess whether the submitted code
    successfully accomplishes the task or not. We expect that the majority of
    submitted assignments will be complete and accomplish the stated goals, but
    100% task success is not a condition for participation or payment.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, after solving several problems, we will ask you about your
    impressions of the software and any comments you have.

    <strong>Qualifications:</strong>
    You must be proficient in Python. Answers will be monitored, and must be
    reasonably accurate (i.e. obvious examples should almost all be correct) to
    receive compensation. You must be at least 18 to participate in the study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Time Involved and Compensation:</strong>
    You will be asked to do 8-10 programming assignments. Based on our
    experience we estimate that this will take about 30 minutes per assignment
    (some taking more than others). We will compensate $5 per assignment (no
    compensation will be given unless all assignments are completed). Once
    starting the job, you will be expected to complete all assignments within 7
    calendar days, and no compensation will be given for late submissions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Data Usage:</strong>
    In your application to perform the job, we will ask for your contact
    information and physical location (which we need to know to set up a
    low-latency server near your location), as well as a number of questions to
    gauge your Python programming experience. At no time will we share your
    contact information or location with people outside of our research team.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How to Apply and Right to Withdraw: </strong>
    If you are interested in performing the job, please complete <a href="https://forms.gle/xP8jw22fWimxUXySA">this survey</a>. We will perform a simple screening process based on your
    programming experience. If we determine that you are eligible to
    participate, we will give you a link to the study. After you accept the
    job, you may withdraw any time if you feel that you are not able or willing
    to perform the tasks involved.
